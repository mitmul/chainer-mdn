# Mixture Density Network with Chainer

This is an example code of Mixture Density Network implemented with Chainer.
All the parameters, network design, and how to prepare synthetic data are the same as this article: [Mixture Density Networks with TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/11/24/mixture-density-networks-with-tensorflow/).

This repository is intended to be a draft for a repository in [chainer/models](https://github.com/chainer/models) which is to collect self-contained Chainer examples.

## Requirements

- [Chainer](https://chainer.org) v4.1.0
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) v1.14.0
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) v2.1.2

## Train

```
python train.py
```

## Results

### Target data:

![target data](images/target.png)

### Generated data from the trained MDN:
